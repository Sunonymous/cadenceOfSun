;; Now I could add a randomized modifier.
;; In the data file, we need a map of modifiers. Each keyword in the map
;; references a separate listing of modifiers. Modifiers are a vector of
;; strings.
;; Thinking about maintaining lists of expressions.
;; Perhaps we were overcomplicating it before.
;; The pattern is:
;; Stored in static data is a set of modifiers.
;; I'm collecting a set of all these items that I've encountered.
;; I can compare them by count to see if I have encountered all of them.
;;; That's a good moment to reset the collection and try again.
;; Otherwise, I can just pluck a random one out of an adjusted collection,
;;; which is the full collection with the seen modifiers removed
;;; and place the new one into the seen collection and the active display

;; That, and we're wanting a better interface for changing the cycle.
;; Need to drag in that metronome from mpt2 and incorporate it into this tool.

;; This is a bit of a philosophical question, almost.
;; Should it be considered a sequential lap if the user has altered the
;; direction or semitone delta of the sequence?
;; One could say it is still A -> A, with a different path...
;; But it's still something distinct to practice, no?
;; To update this to factor in, we would have to encode the summary of the
;; sequence into db. Something like `:0-ascending-5` for <starting-index>-<ascending?>-<semitone-delta>

;; I think there's a discrepancy in the nomenclature here.
;; check index and previous-tone
