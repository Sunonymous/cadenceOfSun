;; Things to consider for later:
;; Line "health", ie. can only move lines to tomorrow for a certain number of times before it is disallowed.
;; Cycled lines, ie. lines that reappear daily.

;; Let's codify the basics of a virtual working memory.
; Its objects are simple strings of text.
;   IDs? Metadata? Extraneous!
; They are fast to create and effortless to destroy.
;   Such is the nature of the mind.
;
; So there are lines of text.
; In the future, it could be useful to allow inner strings.
; What can we do with these strings?
